	/**
	 * If non-empty, indicates that the named file should already exist, and the
	 *  content here is to be inserted into that file at a defined insertion
	 *  point.  This feature allows a code generator to extend the output
	 *  produced by another code generator.  The original generator may provide
	 *  insertion points by placing special annotations in the file that look
	 *  like:
	 *    @@protoc_insertion_point(NAME)
	 *  The annotation can have arbitrary text before and after it on the line,
	 *  which allows it to be placed in a comment.  NAME should be replaced with
	 *  an identifier naming the point -- this is what other generators will use
	 *  as the insertion_point.  Code inserted at this point will be placed
	 *  immediately above the line containing the insertion point (thus multiple
	 *  insertions to the same point will come out in the order they were added).
	 *  The double-@ is intended to make it unlikely that the generated code
	 *  could contain things that look like insertion points by accident.
	 *
	 *  For example, the C++ code generator places the following line in the
	 *  .pb.h files that it generates:
	 *    // @@protoc_insertion_point(namespace_scope)
	 *  This line appears within the scope of the file's package namespace, but
	 *  outside of any particular class.  Another plugin can then specify the
	 *  insertion_point "namespace_scope" to generate additional classes or
	 *  other declarations that should be placed in this scope.
	 *
	 *  Note that if the line containing the insertion point begins with
	 *  whitespace, the same whitespace will be added to every line of the
	 *  inserted text.  This is useful for languages like Python, where
	 *  indentation matters.  In these languages, the insertion point comment
	 *  should be indented the same amount as any inserted code will need to be
	 *  in order to work correctly in that context.
	 *
	 *  The code generator that generates the initial file and the one which
	 *  inserts into it must both run as part of a single invocation of protoc.
	 *  Code generators are executed in the order in which they appear on the
	 *  command line.
	 *
	 *  If |insertion_point| is present, |name| must also be present.
