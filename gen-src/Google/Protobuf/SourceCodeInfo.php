	/**
	 * A Location identifies a piece of source code in a .proto file which
	 *  corresponds to a particular definition.  This information is intended
	 *  to be useful to IDEs, code indexers, documentation generators, and similar
	 *  tools.
	 *
	 *  For example, say we have a file like:
	 *    message Foo {
	 *      optional string foo = 1;
	 *    }
	 *  Let's look at just the field definition:
	 *    optional string foo = 1;
	 *    ^       ^^     ^^  ^  ^^^
	 *    a       bc     de  f  ghi
	 *  We have the following locations:
	 *    span   path               represents
	 *    [a,i)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0 ]     The whole field definition.
	 *    [a,b)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 4 ]  The label (optional).
	 *    [c,d)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 5 ]  The type (string).
	 *    [e,f)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 1 ]  The name (foo).
	 *    [g,h)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 3 ]  The number (1).
	 *
	 *  Notes:
	 *  - A location may refer to a repeated field itself (i.e. not to any
	 *    particular index within it).  This is used whenever a set of elements are
	 *    logically enclosed in a single code segment.  For example, an entire
	 *    extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will
	 *    have an outer location whose path refers to the "extensions" repeated
	 *    field without an index.
	 *  - Multiple locations may have the same path.  This happens when a single
	 *    logical declaration is spread out across multiple places.  The most
	 *    obvious example is the "extend" block again -- there may be multiple
	 *    extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path.
	 *  - A location's span is not always a subset of its parent's span.  For
	 *    example, the "extendee" of an extension declaration appears at the
	 *    beginning of the "extend" block and is shared by all extensions within
	 *    the block.
	 *  - Just because a location's span is a subset of some other location's span
	 *    does not mean that it is a descendent.  For example, a "group" defines
	 *    both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations
	 *    corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap.
	 *  - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to
	 *    ignore those that it doesn't understand, as more types of locations could
	 *    be recorded in the future.
	 *
